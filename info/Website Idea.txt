REPURPOSED IDEA:
Create a web-based application hub for different hobbies
including but not limited to:
	Gardening
	Clockwork
	Music
	Video Games (see below server idea)
----------------------------------------------------
First iteration of website will store data manually via
form based submissions until I can research some APIs
and free data sources online

Include a job eventually to parse through user's 
inventory of seeds and determine possible planting
based on env factors such as PH value and seed zones
----------------------------------------------------
* Monitor Future Videogame Servers (like minecraft)
	° Check if servers are online
	° See Player count and ping of servers
	° Find server IP address
* Forum or Comments for player ideas

NOTES:
----------------------------------------------------
* Database Notes:
	° Table for obscene words (for censorship) 
	° Table for user's (commentary) with hashed passwords
	° Table for servers [server related data]
* Implement framework (like Laravel?)
* Implement git for version control
* Implement CSS framework (TwitterBootstrap)
* Implement virtual enviroment for testing
* Following url contains code for querying servers
